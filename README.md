### PollDash
- Repository already exists, made copy here.
- Example project for my previous employer. First time using NestJS (we used NestJS at that job).
- Took two days to complete, used the NestJS documentation to work through all of the practices and features.
- React on the front-end.
- Redux used on the front-end.

### Solid CMS
- I'm playing around with building a CMS with SolidJS on the front-end. Very similar syntax to React.
- This is just the back-end.
- NodeJS with DI using Inversify (inspired by my experience with NestJS I went the route of creating base classes for the different class structures used in the core modules)


### Solid Block Editor
- More CMS experimentation.
- SolidJS on the front-end.
- Highlighting the MountBlock HOC.
